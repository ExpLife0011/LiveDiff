# LiveDiff

LiveDiff is a portable system-level differencing tool for Microsoft Windows-based operating systems.

## Current Project Status

This project is currently in active development. It has been over 2 years since I last dedicated time for this project which was one aspect of my PhD research topic. I have decided to restart development as there are no actively developed tools that perform similar functionality. The project was initially designed based on RegShot, but with a specific focus on digital forensic requirements. The new development will restore some of the good functionality that RegShot has (output file formats, GUI), while also including the previously implemented digital forensic requirements. However, the project will be rewritten from the ground up, fixing many problems that I currently see in the software.

New documentation will be added as the project progresses. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

The old version of the tool is available in two locations:

1) Source code: See the branch named: `1.4.0`
1) Compiled binaries: See the releases page
