    Reapply the file blacklist (aka - not testing mode)
    Reapply the Registry value blacklist (aka - not testing mode)
    Update profile mode to display correct command convention after 'reboot' mode
    Update profile-rebbot mode to not require 'Enter' to continue scanning
    Fix special XML characters (&, ", ', <, >) for:
        filename
        cellpath
        data
    Fix Unicode control character problem, encode using base64
    Determine problem with some REG_SZ data_types

    Add version numbering to VS project
    Add -V argument to print program version number    
    Implement verbose or debug mode to ease bug discovery/reporting
        Potentially use NLOG like Zimmerman Registry library
    Test on the following Windows operating system versions
        Windows XP (32 and 64 bit)
        Windows Vista (64 bit)
        Windows 8 and 8.1 (32 and 64 bit)
        Windows 10 (32 and 64 bit)
    Fix any problems found during testing
    Determine Regshot changes and implement any identified problems with regshot.c
        or fileshot.c that they have changed     


version 2.0.0 (June 2016)
    Implement 'detailed' mode to:
        Determine modified Registry keys using modified time
        Determine modified directories using write time
        Include access time to file system differencing
