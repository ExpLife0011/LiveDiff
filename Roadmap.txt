    Add version numbering to VS project
    Add -V argument to print program version number    
    Implement verbose or debug mode to ease bug discovery/reporting
    Test on the following Windows operating system versions
        Windows XP (32 and 64 bit)
        Windows Vista (64 bit)
        Windows 8 and 8.1 (32 and 64 bit)
        Windows 10 (32 and 64 bit)
    Fix any problems found during testing
    Determine Regshot changes and implement any identified problems with regshot.c
        or fileshot.c that they have changed     


version 2.0.0 (June 2016)
    Implement 'detailed' mode to:
        Determine modified Registry keys using modified time
        Determine modified directories using write time
        Include access time to file system differencing
        The above would generate many system changes but would be useful
        for very specific system-level reverse engineering (e.g., malware)
